# M4 — Pr0toc01

## Scope
Shell milestone. Details to be filled after M2 ships.

## Known Design Intent
- Ally presence that enters after first gatekeeper event
- Mirrors gatekeeper mechanic from player's perspective — an entity that aids rather than attacks
- Likely has capabilities that complement player's weaknesses

## Placeholder Hooks
The following will be stubbed in M2/M3 so M4 has clean attach points:
- gp_ally_active flag
- gp_ally_<capability> flags (to be defined)
- Event trigger: first gatekeeper bluescreen resolution fires gp_pr0toc01_intro

## To Be Defined
- What Pr0toc01 can do and cannot do
- How player interacts with it
- Whether it has its own hardware/tier system
- Narrative framing
