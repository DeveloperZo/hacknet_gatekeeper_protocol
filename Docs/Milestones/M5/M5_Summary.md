## Scope
Full network population, gatekeeper tiers, progression curve tuning, run seed system.
Everything that makes the game replayable and feels complete.

## Network Population
- h4ck, th3, p14n3t fully populated with varied node types
- Node defense profiles reflect network difficulty tier
- Lore files, flavor text, and narrative threads across nodes
- Gateway nodes between networks with appropriate crack difficulty

## Gatekeeper Tiers
Multiple gatekeeper types with distinct speed profiles:
- Scout: fast overall, weak proxy resistance — early game
- Enforcer: strong firewall bypass, moderate proxy — mid game
- Apex: high resistance across all types — late game
- Special variants tied to narrative events

Gatekeeper tier scales with player hardware tier and run progression.

## Progression Curve Tuning
- Hardware upgrade cost curve balanced against income rate
- Network reward scaling reviewed end-to-end
- Gatekeeper attack frequency and intensity curve
- Loss formula decay_curve tuned so early losses feel survivable, late losses feel earned

## Run Seed System
Each run gets a seed that determines:
- Network node layout and defense levels
- Gatekeeper speed profile variance
- Resource drop rates
- Shop stock and pricing variance

Seed printed at run start, can be shared for reproducible runs.

## Completion Criteria
- All three networks fully populated and traversable
- All gatekeeper tiers implemented and scaling correctly
- Full run playable start to finish with no dead ends
- Progression curve playtested and tuned
- Seed system produces consistent results per seed
- No crash conditions under normal play
